## What is this?

This is a gateway between Discord and Slack. It allows you to send messages from Discord to Slack and vice versa.

## How to use it?

### Installation

```
npm i discord-slack-gateway
```

### Example

```js
const { DiscordSlackGateway } = require('discord-slack-gateway');
const gateway = new DiscordSlackGateway({
    slack: {
        token: "...",
        appToken: "...",
        signingToken: "...",
        channelId: "...",
        webhookUrl: "...",
        socketMode: true
    },
    discord: {
        webhookUrl: "...",
        channelId: "...",
        apiToken: "..."
    }
});
```

_I highly recommend using socket mode for Slack. It is much faster than the Events API. Also, use environment variables for tokens and other sensitive data_
